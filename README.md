## Inspiration

As developers, Devin and Nathan have loved video games and the making of video games. Finding a platform that we were able to build a game with javascript/typescript was very exciting. Tifanny decided to join us in our endeavors, because she knew our webpages could use our help. Tifanny has also enjoyed playing a view hours of call of duty, and has since decided that our game is better.

## Breakdown of Tasks

```
- Tifanny - Database Doctor, HTML/View expert, Bulma Queen, functional Javascript ninja. 
- Devin - Github Guru, Presentation Purveyor, Project Manager, API researcher
- Nathan - Node/Express master, Data Flow Doctor, Tiled map maker/video editor. Video editor is a very loose term here. 
That being said, the distribution of tasks and completion of them felt very even to us. We were happy to work together. 
```

## Future Development

```
More interaction with game environment
Inventory system - possibly with VueJS
Passport Authentication and login
Music/Sound Effects
Save game function
Quests - To complete the quests users will need to complete tasks related to JavaScript and coding as a whole.
Ex: In order to get an item from a chest you will need to finish a section of incomplete code in order to access the chests contents.
